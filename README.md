DESCRIPTION: I worked on developing a responsive webpage that fetches and displays data from a public API. The main goal of this task was to understand how to integrate external data sources into a web application and present the information in a clean, user-friendly layout. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code to build the project.I implemented the API call using JavaScriptâ€™s fetch() method, which allowed me to retrieve real-time data from a free public API. Once the data was successfully fetched, I dynamically inserted it into the web page using DOM manipulation techniques. This helped me learn how to work with asynchronous data and display it efficiently on the front end.I also focused on making the webpage fully responsive. By using CSS Flexbox and media queries, the layout adjusts automatically across different screen sizes such as mobile, tablet, and desktop. This project helped me improve my skills in front-end development, especially in working with APIs and creating dynamic content.
Overall, this was a great learning experience for me as it introduced me to real-world web development practices and enhanced my understanding of responsive design and data-driven interfaces.
